Pac-Man Map Generator
=====================

This is an experiment to generate random Pac-Man maps.  I'm trying to figure out what rules will create maps that look and feel like the original maps.

Works in Progress
-----------------

The 'heuristics' folder contains a Python solution that uses a special heuristic for progressively placing random valid walls.

The 'answerset' folder contains a [Clingo](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/#clingo) solution that specifies declarative constraints.

This [blog post](http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/2011/10/map-generation-speedrun/) is a good introduction to map generation using Clingo.
